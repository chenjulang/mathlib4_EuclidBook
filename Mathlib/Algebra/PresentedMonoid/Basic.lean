# Defining a monoid given by generators and relations

Given a subset `rels` of relations of the free monoid on a type `α`, this file constructs the monoid
given by generators `x : α` and relations `r ∈ rels`.

## Main definitions

* `PresentedMonoid rels`: the quot group of the free group on a type `α` by the steps-to closure
  of a subset `rels` of relations of the free monoid on `α`.
* `of`: The canonical map from `α` to a presented monoid with generators `α`.
* `toMonoid f`: the canonical monoid homomorphism `PresentedMonoid rels → M`, given a function
  `f : α → G` from a type `α` to a monoid `M` which satisfies the relations `rels`.
